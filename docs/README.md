# Oficial documentation

## Overview
Before starting the details, let's check the overview of the system.
This is a project of a laser engraver CNC machine controlled by a mobile app and cloud computing. It's divided in 3 parts: remote API, mobile app and the embedded system. Let's check the flow of operation:
 - First you must open the mobile app, choose a PNG image from your gallery or take a picture within the app.
 - The app will send the corresponding image for the remote api via **http**.
 - The image will be processed by some filters and the preview will return to the app.
 - In the app you will click to engrave the image and then, the api will translate the image to [Gcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) and publish it in a **mqtt** topic.
 - An ESP32 subscribed in the topic will receive the Gcode and then send it to the Arduino via Serial UART.
 - The Arduino is hosting the firmware which will control the hardware through Gcode.

This document explains how we've projected the laser engraver in both aspects: **Hardware** and **Software**. Let's start talking about Hardware, which is the base for the project and it makes you understand the software part more easily. 

## Hardware
The hardware design for this project depends on the CNC controller you will choose. In this way, we have chosen the [GRBL V1.1](https://github.com/gnea/grbl). It's a firmware that translates **Gcode** into signals for stepper motor movements and laser activation. Sure, let's proceed with the list of materials based on that:

### Stepper motors
In our case, we have encountered some old DVD drivers with the stepper motors, but you can use other stepper motors like Nemma-17 for example. The good part of DVD stepper motors is that it comes with structure and rails that will be used in the project.

Below there's the specification of the stepper motor:

This image contains some informations that will be used to calibrate the GRBL later. For example: the step angle of the motor is 18ยบ. In this way, for a complete  revolution (360ยบ), you will need 20 steps. The lead pitch is important too. It says about linear distance the carriage travels in one revolution.

#
### Arduino and GRBL
You can check how GRBL works [here](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki). However, I will talk about some important details below.

#### Before flashing
Before flashing the GRBL to the Arduino, you must modify some details that will be defined in compile time. These datails concern about **two axis system operation**. Check [this](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki/Two-Axis-System-Considerations) topic first. After that, you must [upload](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki/Compiling-Grbl) GRBL.

#### Using GRBL
After adjusting the details and uploading the GRBL to the Arduino, you can communicate with it by Serial monitor at Arduino IDE. Set the baud rate to 115200 and check the commands in the [documentation](https://github.com/gnea/grbl/wiki/Grbl-v1.1-Commands). Backing to the hardware project, below there's the pinout for Aruino with GRBL.
![alt text](image-1.png)

For this project we only use the following pins: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 11.
**The pins 0 and 1 are used for serial communication with ESP32.**
**The pin 11 is used for laser activation**

#### Laser mode and calibration
Let's activate the laser mode. GRBL has a lot of environment variales stored in EPROM. These variables control set parameters and control some behaviors of the firmware. For laser mode we must set the \$32 flag to **\$32=1**. 

We also must set other flags like steps/mm. This parameter depends on the stepper motor parameters as I said above. We can calculate it by:
**steps_per_mm = (steps_per_revolution*microsteps)/mm_per_rev**

Microsteps depends on the Easydriver configuration. Check the next section.

#
### Motor driver
The Easydriver V44 A3967 is an easy way to controll the stepper motor. You just need to connect some pins to the Arduino and it works magically. Check the connections in the schematic. 

#### Microstepping
This driver has 4 modes of microstepping that can be checked [here](https://www.schmalzhaus.com/EasyDriver/). The default is 1/8. It means that you need 8 microsteps to complete 1 normal step. It will be used to calculate the steps/mm in the section above. 

#
### Laser connection
The laser works around 5V. However, we can't connect it directly to the pin11 of Arduino. The current it drains is so high and it would ruin the microcontroller. In this way, we chose to use a MOSFET. The PWM from pin11 connected to the gate of transistor will turn on the drain-source junction and power the laser.

#### IRFZ44N
This is the chose mosfet. The datasheet is [here](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-IRFZ44N-DataSheet-v01_01-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d462533600a40153563b3a9f220d). You can choose a simpler one, because this is oversized. We wanted to make sure it wouldn't burn. 

#### Voltage regulator module XL4015
This module has a trimpot to regulate the voltage from the output. Testing the laser with the mosfet, we've got a 5.33V output in the regulator to a 4.95V voltage drop across the laser (connecting laser between regulator and mosfet drain like in the schematic).

* We've used three voltage regulators in this project because Arduino works around 7 and 12V, ESP32 works at exactly 5V and the laser module needs a little more of voltage to work fine (5.33V). However, if you wanna reproduce this project, do your own tests with laser module, transistor and voltage regulator, because the laser works between 3V and 5V and you can ruin it with wrong voltages.
